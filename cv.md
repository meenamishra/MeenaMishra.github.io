`Current`
__PhD Student - Clinical Informatics__, DMICE, OHSU 

`2009-2016`
__Clinical Research Associate__, Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Division, OHSU                                              

- Managed and coordinated numerous industry (Osiris, Chimerix and Jazz) and consortium (COG, BMT CTN) sponsored, phase II and III, multi-center trials in pediatric cancer, bone marrow transplant and supportive care.
- Maintained regulatory compliance with local and central IRB, coordinated sponsor and monitor site visits, submitted study data and case report forms, prepared and submitted adverse events to sponsor and IRB, ensured drug accountability, ensured source documentation, addressed and reconciled audit findings.
- Part of a team that developed electronic patient repository.
- Maintained local transplant database.
- Sent weekly open studies reports to the providers, trained new team members, fellows and volunteers on study related processes and systems.

`2007-2009`
__Registry Coordinator__, Center for Hematologic Malignancies, OHSU

- Supported transition from paper to electronic data reporting system. 
- Planned and implemented data catch process to clear all backlogs. 
- Helped develop an investigator initiated study.

`1998-2000`
__Lab Technician 3__, Department of Molecular and Medical Genetics, OHSU   

-Supported research project looking at the relationship between the presence of Ureaplasma urealyticum in the tracheal aspirates of very low birth weight babies and incidence of Chronic Lung Disease (CLD). Used Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) as a preferred technique to detect and quantify the bacterium.
-Designed and executed experiments and ordered lab supplies.
-Designed a basic Access database for my research data. 

`2007-2009`
__Graduate Assistant__, School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC   
				          
- Used molecular techniques such as PAGE and Western Blot for a research project that involved studying heat shock proteins in oysters. The project was aimed at studying relationship between levels of heat shock protein, Hsp 70, in transplanted oysters in response to the various contaminant stresses. 
- Designed and executed experiments, collected, analyzed and interpreted data. 

`1992-1993`
__Junior Research Fellow__, Department of Biotechnology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India

- Assisted in the study of time kinetics of cytokines after the exposure of human T cells to M. leprae. The study involved the use of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) techniques and Western Blots.
